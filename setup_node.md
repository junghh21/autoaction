📦 What Is node_modules?
It’s the folder where npm (Node Package Manager) installs all the packages your project depends on.
When you run npm install, it reads your package.json file and downloads the listed packages into node_modules.

🧠 Why It Exists
Dependency Storage: Keeps all third-party libraries (like Express, React, Lodash) in one place.
Module Resolution: Node.js automatically looks in node_modules when you use require() or import.
Isolation: Each project gets its own set of dependencies, avoiding version conflicts.

🛠️ Typical Workflow
You create a project:
bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
npm init -y

You install a package:
bash
npm install express

It creates:
node_modules/ → contains Express and its dependencies
package-lock.json → locks exact versions
Updates package.json → adds Express to your dependencies

⚠️ Should You Commit It to Git?
No. You should add node_modules to your .gitignore file. Instead, commit your package.json and package-lock.json, so others can recreate the environment with npm install.

🚀 How to Run Your Server
Install dependencies (if you haven’t yet):
bash
npm install

Start the server:
bash
npm start

> simple-html-server@1.0.0 start
> http-server -c-1

Starting up http-server, serving ./

http-server version: 14.1.1

http-server settings:
CORS: disabled
Cache: -1 seconds
Connection Timeout: 120 seconds
Directory Listings: visible
AutoIndex: visible
Serve GZIP Files: false
Serve Brotli Files: false
Default File Extension: none

Available on:
  http://100.120.100.29:8081
  http://127.0.0.1:8081
  http://127.0.0.1:8081
  http://172.29.32.1:8081
  http://172.22.240.1:8081
  http://172.21.32.1:8081
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server


Access your site: Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080
You’ll see your index.html rendered beautifully.

🧠 What Does -c-1 Do?
The -c-1 flag disables caching, which is great for development because:
You always get the latest version of your files
No need to clear browser cache manually

💡 Pro Tips
Want to change the port?
bash
http-server -p 3000

Want to serve from a different folder?
bash
http-server ./public

Want to use it in GitHub Actions? 
You can run http-server as part of a test or preview step in your CI pipeline.
